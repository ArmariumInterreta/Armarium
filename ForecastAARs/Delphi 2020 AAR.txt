-Implementing region definitions - often correlations that may be missed in demographic correlation but may show up in region-based swings
-Consider greater uncertainty in elections with few precedents/small sample size
-Consider different models for Green vote - inner-city trend towards Greens may be an issue (Greens may increase vote in such seats while losing everywhere else)
-Although minor party model held up fairly well this time, may want to consider more categories (e.g. 'Nationalist' category which may preference ON and vice versa, overcoming low primary to win from behind)
-Consider different methods of modelling 2pp error - QLD state Newspoll has avg error of 1.82% while polling averages have avg error of 1.46%; did not account for this by increasing uncertainty in model. May want to develop dynamic model of polling error based on which pollsters are in polling mix?
-Need to develop fundamentals model; likely will need to rethink decision to downweight opposite state govt results in fundamentals
-Result also seem to suggest popular PM does not overcome federal drag? May need to consider methods of assessing when PM popularity is artifically inflated (vs voting intention)
-Need more rigorous method of assessing personal vote effects
-Need to estimate effectiveness of seat polls at state level
-Consider if members elected at previous election in new seats gain sophomore swing
-Need to better account for 2pp swing due to minor party sophomore swing (e.g. Greens win seat - does seat 2pp increase in favour of Labor at next election alongside Green primary?) - e.g. Mirani
-Recalculate minor party/independent sophomore surge - likely larger than 5%
